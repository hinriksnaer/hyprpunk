# Workspace Configuration

# Workspaces are created dynamically as needed
# No persistence - workspaces exist only when they have windows

# Optional: Define default workspace assignments for specific monitors
# Example (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# workspace = 1, monitor:DP-1, default:true
# workspace = 2, monitor:DP-1
# workspace = 6, monitor:HDMI-A-1, default:true

# Optional: Set up special workspaces
# Special workspaces are scratchpad-like workspaces that can be toggled
# Already configured: emergency terminal (Super+Shift+Return)
